        Jenky is a beautiful radiator for your Jenkins CI server.

        Most radiators are functional but not pretty. Jenky tries to be both. This means that how Jenky presents
        information is just as important as the information itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have made most of the choices related to aesthetics and user experience for you. This includes things like
        colours, use of white space, and making the information hierarchy obvious.

    <p>
        We hope you enjoy using Jenky!
